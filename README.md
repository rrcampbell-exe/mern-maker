## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
To install this app locally, clone it to your device.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Usage
With the app open in your IDE, run `npm start` or `node index` from the root directory and answer the prompts provided.

Once you have answered the prompts, MERN Maker gets to work. **Please be patient as the MERN Maker builds your project.** 

Depending on your device and the quality of your internet connection, it can take several minutes to create all of the files necessary for out-of-the-box functionality.

The console will confirm when the build is complete.

**Note: You may receive errors in the console related to the functionality of GraphQL, but please note that as of October 29th, 2021, these errors do not inhibit the app's functionality.**

Once the build is complete, visit the `dist` directory and relocate the folder with your project's name to your desired location.

If you chose to create a project with a database included, then, from the root of your project, you may optionally run `npm run seed` to seed your database with the provided user seeds.

To run projects that feature a server, use command `npm run develop` while in your project's root directory. Otherwise, from the same directory, use command `npm run start` to initialize your project.

The front end will then run on `localhost:3000`, with the ability to interface with your optional database via GraphQL queries in the Apollo Client running on `localhost:3001/graphql`.
